			| Revisions is a simple and easy way to track & share versions of your files as you create them.
			br
			| The idea is simple. You add files you are working on to Revisions and the app keeps track of how they change over time.
			br
			| Then at any point if you want to see what your file looked like in an earlier state you can simply save a copy of any previous version with the click of a button.
			br
			| No more folders of my-file-v2, my-file-v3, my-file-v4, etc!!
			p
			| Revisions runs on top of 
			a(href='http://get.adobe.com/air', target='_blank') Adobe Air
			| , leverages the open source 
			a(href='http://git-scm.com/', target='_blank') Git
			|  library under the hood and seamlessly integrates with your existing 
			a(href='https://github.com/', target='_blank') Github
			|  &
			a(href='http://beanstalkapp.com/', target='_blank')  Beanstalk
			|  accounts.
